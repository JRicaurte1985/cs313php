<body>
<!--here I want to check first if they voted or not. If so I open a file called votingResult.txt. If it doesn't exist, create it and use a for loop to write 14 consecutive zeroes.

I check the post array and do a series of if statements to see what values need to be incremented. I can make a local temp array and store the value read in the file plus the increment. once the local array is filled I rewrite the file with its values. I can then display the results straight from the txt file-->
