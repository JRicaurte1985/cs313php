	<h1>Welcome to Jose Ricaurte's CS 313 Homepage</h1>
		

	
	<div class= "intro">	
		I am a student at Brigham Young University - Idaho majoring in Computer Science. I was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador
		and moved to the United States when I was two years old. I grew up in Newburgh, NY and from a young age I was a gamer. I loved computer games but I never
		thought about learning how to program until my third semester of college. I quickly fell in love with coding and changed my major from Biology to Computer
		Science. On my free time I dabble in game programming and practice the guitar.
